    <string name="beta_screen">"Thanks for installing Gaku! This program is a fork of the no-longer maintained Kaku app, with the goal of replacing the OCR engine with a more reliable one from Google. I do not intend to maintain this project, so feel free to contribute however you see fit. Note that the codebase was largely vibe-coded to produce a minimum-viable-product, as I am not an android developer. I'm sorry if the changes cause any future maintainers headache.
